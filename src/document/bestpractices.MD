# When using ReduxJS, split your Reducer code into smaller methods to avoid huge JSON within your Reducer.
# Use the create-react-app generator to bootstrap your ReactJS app.
# Keep your code DRY. Don’t Repeat Yourself, but keep in mind code duplicate is NOT always a bad thing.
# Avoid having large classes, methods or components, including Reducers.
# Use more robust managers to manage application state, such as Redux.
# Use event synchronizer, such as Redux-Thunk, for interactions with your back end API.
# Avoid passing too many attributes or arguments. Limit yourself to five props that you pass into your component.
# Use ReactJS defaultProps and ReactJS propTypes.
# Use linter, break up lines that are too long.
# Always use a dependency manager with a lock file, such as NPM or yarn.
# Test your commonly accessed code, code that is complex and prone to bugs.
# Write more tests that give more test coverage for your code with a little effort and test code to ensure its proper functioning.
# Every time you find a bug, make sure you write a test first.
# Use function-based components by starting to use React Hooks, a new ReactJS way to create state-full components.
# Use ES6 de-structuring for your props.
# Use conditional rendering.
# User `map()` to collect and render collections of components.
# Use partial components, such as `<>` … `</>`
# Name your event handlers with handle prefixes, such as `handleClick()` or `handleUpdate()`.
# Use JEST to test your ReactJS code.
